# Product Introduction

> For MiBeeNvr v0.11.0

MiBee NVR is a lightweight, self-hosted Network Video Recorder written in Go. It captures IP camera video streams as MP4 segments and saves them to disk, providing a modern web interface for live viewing, camera management, and recorded footage access.

**Core design principles:**

- **Push-In ingest**: remote publishers push streams into the NVR (SRT / RTMP) — the NVR never needs to connect to cameras
- **Push-Out relay**: the NVR forwards live camera streams to remote targets (RTMP / RTSP), implemented in pure Go
- **StreamHub frame bus**: all protocols share a single fan-out frame bus — recording / live / relay run independently
- **SQLite storage**: recording metadata, camera configs, and timelapse merge records are all stored in a single-file database

## Supported Cameras

| Type | Protocol | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| RTSP H.264 / H.265 | rtsp | Most IP cameras (Hikvision, Dahua, Uniview, etc.) |
| ONVIF | onvif | Zero-config discovery + auto encoding detection |
| MJPEG | rtsp | Low-resolution cameras |
| HTTP JPEG | http | Snapshot-based cameras |
| Xiaomi | xiaomi | C200 / C300 / Dual-lens TUTK P2P |
| GB/T 28181 | gb28181 | Chinese national video surveillance standard (experimental) |
| SRT / RTMP | srt / rtmp | Push ingest, cross-network cameras |
| Timelapse | timelapse | Dedicated timelapse mode |
