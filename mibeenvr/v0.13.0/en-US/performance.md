## Memory Tiering

Three consumers compete for RAM on an NVR host, and misunderstanding their
relationship is the root of most "mysterious slowdowns":

| Tier | What it is | Who manages it | What happens when squeezed |
|------|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Go heap | Recorder ring buffers, merge sample metadata, API JSON | The Go runtime (GC) | GC runs hotter; recording latency rises |
| Page cache | Kernel cache of recording files | The kernel | Every read/write hits the disk → I/O amplification |
| tmpfs | `/tmp` extraction scratch (#746 lesson) | The kernel (RAM-backed) | Occupies RAM the heap believes it owns |

The default Go behavior (GOGC=100, no memory limit) grows the heap
aggressively: on a 4GB production host the NVR process peaked at 1.6GB and
evicted the page cache that recording I/O depended on — the extra disk reads
showed up as I/O stalls that looked like a storage problem but were a memory
problem.

### Automatic GOMEMLIMIT

Since #756 the server startup path installs a conservative **soft** memory
limit (`debug.SetMemoryLimit`) before any manager starts allocating:

```text
limit = min( 45% of physical RAM, 1 GiB )            # physical tier
limit = min( limit, 80% of the cgroup memory cap )   # when a cap exists
floor = 64 MiB                                        # never lower
```

Precedence — the first that applies wins:

1. `GOMEMLIMIT` env var (applied natively by the runtime before `main`;
   the NVR detects it and touches nothing),
2. `memory.soft_limit_bytes` in `mibee-nvr.yaml` (explicit operator value),
3. the automatic heuristic above.

To opt out of the heuristic:

```yaml
memory:
  disable_auto_limit: true   # keep the Go runtime default
```

The applied value is logged at startup (`process memory soft limit set`) and
published as the `nvr_memlimit_bytes` metric (0 = not set).

A soft limit never OOM-kills by itself — near the limit the GC simply works
harder. GOGC stays at its default; if you ever see GC thrash (rising
`go_memstats_gc_cpu_fraction`), raise `memory.soft_limit_bytes`.

### systemd / Docker outer limits

The in-process limit is the primary mechanism; the unit limits below are the
optional safety net (commented out by default in `deploy/mibee-nvr.service` —
the 512MiB-baseline values would OOM a bigger board if enabled verbatim;
uncomment and size per board):

```ini
# MemoryHigh=450M   # soft: kernel reclaims instead of killing (1GB-board example)
# MemoryMax=550M    # hard backstop (4GB board: 1500M / 2G)
```

Values are sized for the 512MiB design baseline (RPi-3B class). On a 4GB
board use `High=1500M` / `Max=2G`. For Docker, see the commented `mem_limit`
example in `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml` — a cgroup cap is also picked
up by the automatic heuristic (80% tier) inside the container.

## Background I/O Budgeting

Merge, cleanup deletes, repair and timelapse extraction are **background**
work; recording writes, API file serving and SQLite are **foreground** work.
On one kernel I/O queue they otherwise compete as equals — production
measurements showed ~60% PSI io-some with multi-second API stalls while a
timelapse merge ran (#748/#751).

Enable the shared byte-rate budget to make background work yield:

```yaml
io:
  budget_bytes_per_sec: 16777216   # 16 MiB/s ≈ 25% of a slow SD card
  # budget_burst_bytes: 33554432   # optional; default = one second of rate
  # delete_unlinks_per_sec: 200    # frame-tree unlink guardrail (default 200)
```

- **Off by default** — `budget_bytes_per_sec: 0` (or section absent) keeps
  behavior identical to previous releases.
- A sensible value is ~25% of the storage medium's sequential write
  throughput; busy media then automatically stretches background jobs while
  foreground work keeps its latency.
- The unlink guardrail additionally caps recursive frame-tree deletion at
  200 files/s (configurable), preventing the ext4 journal (jbd2) saturation
  that self-sustains even after the deleting process exits.

### Tenant Panorama

Every I/O tenant sharing the one token bucket (the `consumer` label in metrics):

| Tenant | What is billed | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| `merge` | Rolling / batch merge reads and writes | Existing |
| `cleanup` | Retention / disk-watermark cleanup deletes | Existing |
| `repair` | Repair mass-deletes | Existing |
| `timelapse` | Timelapse frame extraction | Existing |
| `transcode` | Transcode input reads + output writes, billed at input size × 2 (#848) | Existing |
| `offload` | S3 object-storage cold-archive uploads (#874) | v0.13 |
| `recording` | Segment-sample writes, billed per NALU byte | v0.13 gray-release, off by default (#886) |
| `playback` | API media-serving reads, billed per read chunk | v0.13 gray-release, off by default (#886) |

Observability: `nvr_iobudget_wait_seconds_total{consumer}` (time spent parked)
and `nvr_iobudget_bytes_charged_total{consumer}` /
`nvr_iobudget_unlinks_charged_total{consumer}` (billed volume).

### Foreground gray-release switches (v0.13, #886)

By default the budget only constrains background work; v0.13 adds two
gray-release switches that bring **foreground** I/O into the same budget:

```yaml
io:
  budget_bytes_per_sec: 16777216    # prerequisite: the budget itself is enabled
  recording_writes_budgeted: false  # segment writes billed per NALU byte to the "recording" tenant
  playback_reads_budgeted: false    # API media-serving reads billed per read chunk to the "playback" tenant
```

- **Default false — zero behavior change while off**, identical to previous
  releases; both require `budget_bytes_per_sec > 0`.
- `recording_writes_budgeted`: segment-sample writes are charged before the
  muxer write and block when the bucket is starved (the recorder ring buffer
  absorbs the delay; frames drop only if a stall outlasts it). Only makes sense
  on media where unbounded recording writes themselves are the latency problem —
  e.g. an SD card simultaneously serving merges and playback downloads. Code:
  `internal/recorder/iobudget.go`.
- `playback_reads_budgeted`: playback / download file reads are charged in
  `http.ServeContent`-sized chunks; a starved bucket paces the transfer
  (Range / negotiation semantics unchanged). Code: `internal/api/playback_budget.go`.
- **Watch the iobudget metrics before enabling**: confirm
  `nvr_iobudget_wait_seconds_total` has headroom, and re-check after flipping
  that foreground waits stay bounded.

The `mibee-nvr repair delete-by-format` CLI reads the same `io:` section
from the YAML, so a manual mass-delete against a live server yields exactly
like the server's own cleanup.

### Fragment batch folding (#852)

A flapping camera (flaky Wi-Fi/power, CS2 EOFs, cascade churn) produces one ~7s fragment per
reconnect; every rolling-merge fold is a full-bucket read+rewrite (the streaming
`MergeMP4Segments([bucket, segment])` pass), so a single sick camera can drive 36 full rewrites
per minute and push PSI io some to 86% (#851 field data). Fragment batching holds MP4 segments
shorter than 30s in a metadata-only queue and folds the whole batch in ONE pass — full-bucket
rewrites drop to ~1/N.

```yaml
merge:
  rolling_fragment_hold_s: 300   # default; 0 = off (fold per segment); range 0-3600
```

- On by default (metadata-only hold, worst-case memory <1MB — no RPi 3B impact); adjustable or
  disable-able from the Web **Settings → merge** card;
- Flush on whichever comes first: oldest fragment reaches the window / depth 8 / cumulative
  64MB / hour-window rollover / a healthy (>=30s) segment on the same camera rides along; the
  10-minute backfill sweep defers fragments still inside their window;
- Held fragments remain standalone playable recordings — only the merged product appears up to
  one window later.

### Sequential-append bucket (#853, experimental, default off)

#852 cut the fold COUNT to 1/N; the sequential-append bucket cuts the per-fold COST from O(bucket)
to O(segment): capacity slots are reserved in the sample tables at bucket creation, and a fold only
appends the new segment's bytes at the mdat tail plus in-place table patches — existing bytes are
never rewritten. Startup self-check truncates uncommitted tails (crash residue) to the mdat
declaration; capacity exhaustion falls back to the classic full rewrite.

```yaml
merge:
  rolling_append_bucket: false  # default off; experimental, toggle in Web Settings → merge
```

**⚠️ RPi 3B baseline**: ~1-2MB of resident RAM mirror per active camera (72k samples/h × 12-16B);
12 cameras all-on ≈ 12-24MB. Use with care on 1GB devices; default off, user-enabled.

## v0.13 Recording Write-Path Improvements

Three write-path changes in v0.13 remove the I/O spikes segment writes used to
create (observable via the `nvr_segment_write_duration_seconds` metric):

- **Incremental MP4 flushing**: media bytes stream out incrementally during
  recording; only a small moov header remains to patch at Close — the
  full-file burst write at segment close is gone.
- **Per-segment write locks**: cameras no longer serialize each other's segment
  writes; one camera on a slow card does not stall the rest.
- **NALU buffer pooling**: Annex-B framing buffers are pooled per recorder
  (#875), eliminating a heap allocation per NALU and its GC pressure.
